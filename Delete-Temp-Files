#Powershell script to delete c:\windows\temp files
#Setup a scheduled task on <server> to run a PS script (place the script in <path>) 
#that will delete these files once a week. 
###IF PROGRAM IS RUNNING OR FILE IN USE, ACCESS WILL BE DENIED AND TASK WILL NOT COMPLETE FOR THESE FILES--THIS IS OK###

#To test what will happen/be deleted, use the -whatif command. It will print to terminal what will happen when you remove the
#-whatif command
#EX: 'Remove-Item –path <path>* -Filter *somefile* -whatif' This will tell you all files with "somefile"
#in the file name will be deleted, without actually deleting the files.

Remove-Item –path c:\windows\temp\* -recurse
